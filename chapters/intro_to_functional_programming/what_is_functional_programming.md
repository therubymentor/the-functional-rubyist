## What is Functional Programming?

Functional programming is the concept of computing without global variables, mutation, or side effects. Well, that is technically a description of what it isn't.

To go further you can say it is the concept of algebraic computation. Everything is boiled down to a calculation of sorts. These calculations can also be applied partially applied to create larger calculations from smaller ones.
