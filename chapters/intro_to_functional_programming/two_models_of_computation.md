## Two Different Models of Computation

Most of you are probably familiar with the Father of so called "modern computing", the good Mr. Turing. Turing is responsible for for what I will call "stateful computing", or the concept of moving parts. Things like global variables belong to the "stateful computing" model. You may have also heard that "side effects" are bad. These two are part of the same model.

By contrast there is another man who unless you were a Math nerd in school, you might not even know his name. It was Church and the model he put forward is essentially the calculator model, or the "algebraic model". In his model of computing it all boils down to mathematical _functions_ which return a result. There are no global variables, there are no side effects.

You could say the Turing model is about "Operations" while the Church model is about "Calculations".
